# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme employs a structured, collaborative approach to project management that emphasizes clear ownership, iterative delivery, and customer value. The process begins with project initiation, where the business need, success metrics, and stakeholders are documented in a Project One-pager. Stakeholder alignment and high-level planning are established before formal planning—ensuring a shared understanding of goals, timelines, and risks.

Roles and responsibilities are distinctly defined to foster accountability: Project Managers coordinate delivery schedules and risks, Product Managers prioritize the backlog and measure outcomes, Developers implement features and maintain code quality, and QA ensures acceptance criteria are met. The team operates with a rhythm of daily standups, weekly syncs, and sprint reviews, promoting transparency and rapid feedback. Communication is carefully orchestrated—regular updates, decision logs, incident communications, and stakeholder briefings maintain alignment and psychological safety across the organization.

Quality assurance is a core pillar, guided by robust workflows. Work is tracked using a project board with well-defined stages, and pull request policies prioritize small, reviewable increments with clear acceptance criteria. Testing includes unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests, complemented by security scanning in CI and manual QA when necessary. Risks and blockers are managed through weekly reviews and a clear escalation path, with proactive action items tracked for continuous improvement.

Throughout the project lifecycle—from initiation and planning through execution, release, and retrospective—OctoAcme leverages standardized templates, checklists, and feedback loops to drive consistency and repeatability. Retrospectives after each milestone or incident ensure learnings are captured and improvements embedded. This approach accelerates onboarding, reduces dependency on individual knowledge, and maintains a living, accessible documentation culture for the entire team.
